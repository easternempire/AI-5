**Can I view the video recordings for the course?**

Yes. We will be sharing a google drive folder with the recordings here.

**Is there a class GitHub repository?**

Yes. You can find it at ([__link__]).

**Is it necessary for me to be present for the live lectures?**

While not mandatory we urge you to attend all lectures to make sure you do not miss out on any pertinent steps. Missing the live sessions means you'll miss the opportunity for real-time interaction with the instructors and your classmates.
